    "## Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "parse tree one form of graphical IR. Represent source code, much larger than original text: one node for each grammary symbol.  \n",
    "\n",
    "AST another form, near source-level. Keep most infos of parse treee.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): Identical subtrees can be reused, more compact than AST.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can have a lower-level trees closer to machine: represent constant, registers, memory, dereferencing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Trees good to represent source code, less ufesul to represent other properties because of their rigidity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Control-flow Graph (CFG): units are basic blocks: maximal length sequence of branch-free code.  \n",
    "Model flows of control between basic blocks. $G = (N,E)$ with $n \\in N$ basic block, and $e=(n_i,n_j) \\in N)$ a possible transfer of control from block $n_i$ to $n_j$.  \n",
    "Suppose every CFG has unique entry $n_0$ and exit $n_f$. If multiple entries/exists, can use extra edges to handle it.  \n",
    "CFG usually used with another IR.  \n",
    "Node can be shorted than basic block, eg a statement, it has more blocks, longer to traverse.  \n",
    "CFGs needed for many tasks: IR optimizations, instruction scheduling, register allocation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data-dependence graph: flow of values, point of creation to points of use. A node is an operation (eg a statement), and an edge is the flow of a single value from definition to use.  \n",
    "Edges represent contraints on sequencing.  \n",
    "Usually used with another IR. They are used for instructions scheduling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Call graph: represent transfer of control between procedures. Each node is a procedure, and an edge is a call.  \n",
    "Construction difficult because of: separate compilation, function pointers, dyanmic dispatch."

    "## Static Single-Assignment Form\n",

    "Can encode informations about flow of control and flow of data values. Each name is defined only once. Each use of the name on a folowing operation give information about where value originated.  \n",

    "reg2reg: use more register than available, reg allocator must map some to physical, and for others do spilling, requires many load store.  \n",
    "mem2mem: use fewer registers than available, reg allocactor looks for mem values that can be kept in registers, removing load and stores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "RISC compilers usually use reg2reg, because closer to ISA, that doesn't have many mem2mem instructions. And the fact that values in IR stay in registers means it can, with mem2mem this needs to be computed."
