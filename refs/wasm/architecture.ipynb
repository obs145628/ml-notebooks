    "# Design goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Safe: code validated and executed in a memory-safe sandboxed environment.\n",
    "- Hardware and platform independant: Can run on many architecture, platforms, and embedded in many environments.\n",
    "- Compact: small binary format\n",
    "- modular: program divided into many parts handled separatly\n",
    "- efficient: can be decoded, validated and compiled rapidly\n",
    "\n",
    "WASM is virtual ISA (Instruction Set Architecture).  \n",
    "WASM by itself doesn't define any way to interact with environment. It can be done by calling functions provided by the embeder.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Values\n",
    "\n",
    "4 basic types: i32, i64, f32, f64. i32 also used as boolean and memory address.  \n",
    "No distinction between signed and unsigned, interpret as such depending on instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "WASM based on stack machine.  \n",
    "Sequence of instructions executed in order, that manipulate operands stack.  \n",
    "Control instructions to alter control flow: expressed with nested block constructs: loop, conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Traps\n",
    "\n",
    "Some instructions may produce a trap that abort execution and get caugth by embeder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Code is organized into multiple functions. Each function takes a sequence of values as arguments, and returns a sequence of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Array of opaque values. For now, can only be used to store function references, and call a function through a pointer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Contiguous mutable array of bytes. Can be extended dynamically.  \n",
    "Can load/store anywhere on this memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "A WASM binary is a module containing:\n",
    "- functions\n",
    "- table\n",
    "- linear memory\n",
    "- const and mutable globale variables\n",

    "## Embedder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Environment to execute and access WASM code\n",
    "\n",
    "# Semantic Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Decode binary into internal representation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "Performs many checks to make sure module is meaningful and safe (eg type checking)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instantation\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize globals, memories, and tables. Then run module start's function is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Invocation\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeder can execute some exported functions of the module."
