I Introduction

These days, I started to wonder, If I had to recreate a Virtual Machine, how would would I implement it ? Which design ? 
Should I rater do stack based or regsiter based ?
What instructions should be available ?
Will it be a sequence of really low-levlel instructions similar to assembly, or something higher-level ?
To answers all these questions, I figured the best way would be to look at some of the most famous VMs.  

I looked at a few, I will present them in this article. 
I mostly spend my time looking at JVM and WASM, and did 2 small projects to get a better view of how it works.
I also looked a little at other ones: ART/DVM for Android, CLR for .NET languages such as C#, and the VM of CPython.

II JVM and Java Bytecode
