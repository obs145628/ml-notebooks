    "- stack-based instructions have a shorted encoding\n",
    "- stack-based code need much more instructionns\n",
    "- usually stack-based binary program is smaller\n",
    "- register-based program runs faster\n",
    "- stack-based easier to implement for broad range of architectures. (Register-based not convenient with archs with very little registers)."
