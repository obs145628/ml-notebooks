    "\n",
    "An execution provider is an abstraction of a runtime implementation.  \n",
    "When executing a graph, it's divided in subraphs, for each execution provider depending on its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "An execution provided has multiple components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- multiple memory allocators\n",
    "\n",
    "- data-transfer object: to copy from / to device\n",
    "\n",
    "- compute capabilities (which kind of nodes in can execute)\n",
    "\n",
    "- kernel registry: one per provider. Used to register kernel definition and kernel creation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- execution handle: opaque, used by the specific kernel implementations. Depends on execution provided type\n",
    "\n",
    "- type: CPU, CUDA, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution providers have operations implementations, called kernels.  \n",
    "There is a default execution provider, for completness, that cover all operations implementations.  \n",
    "It's considered last when doing the partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Available Execution providers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ACL (Arm Compute Library)\n",
    "\n",
    "## CPU \n",
    "\n",
    "Use Eigen and MLAS (Microsoft Linear Algrebra Subprograms)\n",
    "\n",
    "Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "- number of threads\n",
    "- run operators sequentially or in parallel\n",
    "- graph optimization level\n",

    "## DML (DirectML)\n",
    "\n",
    "## DNNL (MKL-DNN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use openMP for parallelization.  \n",
